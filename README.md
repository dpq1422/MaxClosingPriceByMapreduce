# MaxClosingPricingMapReduceApp Here we are getting maximum selling price for each and every stock symbol for last 20 years and 
I have provided small sample dataset and run same progam with 10 GB data on cluster 
with 10 mappers and it took around 35 secs to process data

See how Spark is speeding up process and how it will reduce I/O basically
